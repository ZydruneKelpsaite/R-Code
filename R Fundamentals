Practice
1.
The Greatest Number
The given code takes 3 numbers as input.
Complete the program to output the maximum of the 3 inputs.

#Code
input <- readLines('stdin')
x <- as.integer(input[1])
y <- as.integer(input[2])
z <- as.integer(input[3])
print(max(x, y, z))


2. Sum in Range
You need to create a function that takes two parameters and returns the sum of all numbers between the two parameters inclusive.
The given code takes two numbers from input and passes them to a function called rangeSum().

Task
Define the rangeSum() function, so that the code works as expected.

Sample Input
4
9

Sample Output
[1] 39

Explanation
For the inputs 4 and 9, the returned value should be 39.

Use the for loop inside the function to execute the required calculation.

#Code
input <- readLines('stdin')
x <- as.integer(input[1])
y <- as.integer(input[2])

rangeSum<-function(x,y){
         result <-0
         for(z in x:y)
         {
                result<-result+z
          }
          return(result)
}
print(rangeSum(x,y))

3. 
Grade Analysis
You have a dataframe that includes grades of students.
Your program needs to take a number as input, and output the number of students who have a grade greater than the given input.
For example, for the input 89, the output should be:
[1] 3
as 3 students have grades greater than 89.

Hint: You can use the length() function to find the number of items in a vector.

#Code

input <- readLines('stdin')
x <- as.integer(input[1])

data <- data.frame(
    "id" = c(1:10),
    "grade" = c(75, 26, 54, 90, 86, 93, 48, 71, 66, 99)
)

print(length(data$grade[data$grade > x ]))

4.
Titanic Survivors
You are working on the Titanic Survivors data set, which includes information on the passengers of the ship.
The data is stored in a CSV file, which is already imported in the given code.
You want to understand how the class of the ticket impacted the survival rate. For that, you need to find and output the mean class value for the passengers who are adults (Age >= 18), grouped by the Survived column.

First, print the whole data set and try to analyze it and understand what column it holds and what they mean.

#Code
x <- read.csv('/usercode/files/titanic.csv')


y <- x[x$Age>=18,]
print(c(by(y$Pclass,y$Survived,mean)))
